# You are given a string S.
# Your task is to find the first occurrence of an alphanumeric character in S
# (read from left to right) that has consecutive repetitions.
# 
# Print the first occurrence of the repeating character. If there are no 
# repeating characters, print -1.
# 
# Sample Input: ..12345678910111213141516171820212223
# Sample Output: 1
# .. is the first repeating character, but it is not alphanumeric.
# 1 is the first (from left to right) alphanumeric repeating character of the 
# string in the substring 111.
# 
# Constraints
# 0 < len(S) < 100
