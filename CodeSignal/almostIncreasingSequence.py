# Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to 
# obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element 
# from the array.
# 
# Note: sequence a0, a1, ... an is considered to be a strictly increasing 
# if a0 < a1 < ... < an.
# Sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.
# 
# For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be solution (sequence) = false.
# There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly 
# increasing sequence.
# 
# For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be solution (sequence) = true.
# You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2].
# Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].
